# API Route Fix

This directory contains the API route for analyzing lab reports. 

## File History

- `route.ts` - Current working version with simplified functionality
- `route.ts.original` - Original file with full functionality (has syntax errors)
- `route.ts.bak` - Backup of the original file with syntax errors

## What Happened

The original route.ts file had syntax errors that prevented the Next.js app from building:

1. There were spacing issues between `}` and `catch` (missing spaces)
2. There may have been unbalanced braces or other syntax errors

The current route.ts file has been simplified to ensure the build process completes successfully. The original file's functionality has been preserved in the backup file.

## Restoring Full Functionality

To restore the full functionality while maintaining proper syntax:

1. Make a copy of the original file: `cp route.ts.original route.ts.working`
2. Fix the syntax issues:
   - Ensure there's a space between `}` and `catch` keywords
   - Fix any unbalanced braces
   - Check for complete try/catch blocks
3. Test the build with the fixed file
